This page contains a bunch of links to useful learning resources. We do our best to keep it updated, so please let us know if you have any suggestions or feedback!

If you're just getting started and what like a quick overview of common programming / computing terms, we've produced a [getting started with computing FAQ](/computing-faq).

    <p>
        <b>Note:</b> Although we are happy to receive suggestions for new resources, as a matter of policy we do not post links to sites which have mainly paid-for content or whose main goal is commercial rather than educational.

#### Starting with Scratch

Scratch is great way to begin learning to code.  It allows you to make cool programs using a drag-and-drop approach and is designed to be fun!
