We're always looking for more helpers!

Helping young people learn to code is hugely rewarding. If you can offer your time for two hours on a Wednesday evening, we’d love to hear from you! Prewired sessions take place weekly on Wednesdays from 5.30 pm to 7.30 pm at CodeBase, 37A Castle St, Edinburgh, EH3 9DZ. We run them pretty much throughout the year, with some breaks during Christmas and Easter. We also hold an annual Summer Hack &mdash; a one-week team-based hackathon. 

Please drop us an email before showing up, so we know who to expect &mdash; hello@prewired.org.

#### How we work

            Prewired is largely unstructured and our main goal is to support the young people in learning whatever it is they want to learn. So volunteering at Prewired consists mostly of wandering around a room full of budding hackers, answering questions, helping to fix bugs, and actively checking on the kids to make sure they’re happy and learning. You don’t need to come every week, but it’s helpful for the kids to have some consistency, so we’d love it if you could come as often as possible.
