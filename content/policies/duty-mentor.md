## Serving as Duty Mentor

The Duty Mentor is either trustee or a person authorised to act as Duty Mentor by the Prewired Board of Trustees.

The Duty Mentor for a given session should be agreed at least one week in advance. If the designated person is unable to attend the session in question, they should arrange for one of the other authorised Duty Mentors to take their place.

## Duties

### Setting Up and Signing in Attendees

1. Arrive at the venue at least 10 minutes in advance.
2. Make yourself known to other volunteers and write your name on the whiteboard.
3. Make sure you have access to the following information:
    - Attendee membership database. 
    - Current session's attendee (Eventbrite) list. 
4. Ensure you are aware of any serious allergies or medical conditions amongst attendees present that evening.
5. Ensure the current session's attendee list is available throughout the session, should a fire evacuation occur.
6. Greet attendees and parents as they arrive. Make sure you focus on new attendees; invite them to choose somewhere to sit and make themselves at home. Make sure they have their own laptop or know where to find the Prewired ones.
7. For new attendees or those looking a bit lost, ask what they're working on. Make suggestions or refer them to another volunteer if you're busy.

### Welcoming New Volunteers

1. Greet new volunteers and explain how Prewired works. 
    - Check if the volunteer has gone through the Disclosure process. Duty Mentors should be aware in advance if a new volunteer is expected. If they have not gone through Disclosure, direct them to our [volunteering](/volunteering) information and ask they contact us online before attending. Unexpected visitors should be politely turned away from sessions.
2. Check if they have been invited to the `#mentor` Slack channel. 
3. Give them a volunteer lanyard to wear during the session and remind them to return it at the end of the evening.

### During the Session

1. Generally oversee things. Rather than focusing on one attendee, check on all of them and find volunteers for those who need help.
2. Deal with any problems not involving coding (e.g., being unwell or upset) and record any accidents in the Accident Log.

### End of the Session

1. At the end of the session, thank attendees and parents as they're leaving and remind them to come back next week!
2. If there any young people who are still waiting to be collected by their guardian at the end of the session, make sure that at least two volunteers (including the Duty Mentor) remain at the venue until they have been collected.
3. Take any feedback from attendees, parents and volunteers to report back to Board.
