â†’ ðŸ‘‹ Please have a read through our information for [Parents and Guardians](/parents-and-guardians).

If you would like to attend Prewired, please:
1. **Complete the one-off [membership form](#membership-form) below.** We use this to collect important things like emergency contact information. *You only need to do this once.*
2. **Once we have your membership details, you can go ahead and [register for a Prewired session (or sessions) on Eventbrite](https://www.eventbrite.co.uk/e/prewired-registration-15338031465).** *You'll have to do this for every session you want to attend - it's how we track attendence and fire safety!*
3. **[Subscribe](https://eepurl.com/dv2dPb) to our mailing list** to keep up to date with notices and events.
4. **Turn up!**
    - Check yourself in on the registration list using the tablet at the front desk - someone at the desk will help you if necessary.
    - If you have never coded before, or have but don't know what to do, no problem! Introduce yourself to the mentors when you arrive, and they'll help you to get started.
    - If you're already working on a coding project or learning a topic by yourself and are happy to carry on with that, cool beans. Make yourself at home and ask any of our volunteers if you need help (they'll be wearing lanyards).
